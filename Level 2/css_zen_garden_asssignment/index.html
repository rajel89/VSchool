            <br>
            <a>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken
                CSS
                support, and abandoned browsers.
                <br>
                We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts
                of
                folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.
                <br>
                The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to

                <br>
                <a>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and
                    encourage
                    participation.
                    To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style
                    sheet into
                    this very page.
                    The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.

            Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are
            necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as
            starting points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.
            <br>

            You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if
            you've never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as
            a guide.
            <br>

            Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and
            please, don't submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a
            link to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it
            and place it on our server.

                amazing
                CSS really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today,
                learning
                tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.

        <a>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported
            elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS
            and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we
            have is that your CSS validates.
            <br>

            Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to
            the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number
            of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not
            be possible across every platform. That's okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work
            in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the
            population).
            <br>
            We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material
            to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We're well past the
            point of needing another garden-related design.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with
            limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons
            license identical to the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.
