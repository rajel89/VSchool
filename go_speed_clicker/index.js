// For this assignment, reference the last two articles.
// Make a site that tracks how many times the user has clicked anywhere on the page (or a specific button if you prefer) and displays that click count to the user.
// Then, using localStorage or sessionStorage, make it so the number of clicks will remain on the screen even after the site is refreshed.

// **Extra credit:**Â Put a countdown timer (10-30 seconds) on the page that stops the user's clicks from counting towards the total after the timer ends.

console.log("Hello World");
